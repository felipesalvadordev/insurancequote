# Insurance Quotation Service

- Customers interact with the Insurance Quotation Service via REST API endpoints.  
- The service validates data using the Catalog API (acessing a WireMock container via Facade). Offer and product data are validate with the Catalog API data.   
- New insurance quotes are persisted in MongoDB.  
- The service sends/receives events via AWS SQS queues for integration with other systems (policy creation notification system).  
- All queue interactions are locally emulated with LocalStack for dev/testing.

# About the project

There are two REST operations: 
- POST/insurance-quotes
- GET/insurance-quotes/{id}

The project uses the following technologies:  
- Spring Boot Java 17
- AWS SQS LocalStack 
- MongoDB
- JUnit & Mockito
- WireMock
- Docker

# Implementantion details
Created using the Hexagonal Architecture with REST inbound port, Broker inbound port and Persistance (Repository) outbound port.  
Use of commands (inbound port) to access the application rules.  
Use of DTOs for data transportation, validation and domain security. The domain entity is not exposed.  
Use of pattern FACADE for external integration. All the external config. is set only in the facade class.  
Use of a global exception handler to display exceptions more friendly to the user.  
Use of pattern BUILDER to create reusable objects for tests.  
Use the 12 FactorApp rule about config storage (https://12factor.net/pt_br/config). All configuration data are stored in yml files, properties and shell scripts. None in the base code.  

# Instructions to run
To execute the APIs integration mock, access mock directory using a terminal and execute:  

docker image build --tag catalog-mocks .  

Run mvn clean package -DskipTests in the project root to create the jar file.  
Create application image after:  
docker build -t insurancequoteapp .

To run the service infrastructure, access src\main\docker folder and execute:  

docker-compose up

The application will run on 8080.  
The mongodb container will run on 27017.  
The localstack container will run on 4566.  
The wiremock container will run on 8088.

# Messaging Integration
### Inbound integration
- queue-insurance-policy-created (Receive an insurance policy created for an insurance quotation)
### Outbound integration
- queue-insurance-policy-received (Post an insurance quote created)

When submit a POST, a message with the newest insurance quotation created will be sent to a AWS SQS queue.  
Also the API can receive a message with the insurance policy created for a update in database insurance quote entity.  

Example of publishing a message using localstack that will be received by the application:

```bash
aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566 sqs send-message  --queue-url http://localhost:4566/000000000000/queue-insurance-policy-created  --profile localstack  --message-body '{
		"insurance_policy_id": "123a492c37e94a61726e8db8",
		"insurance_quote_id": "678a492c37e94a61726e8db8"
	}
}'
```
